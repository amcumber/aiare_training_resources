## Avalanche basics

[Avalanche Triangle](captures/avalanche_triangle.png)

## Snow Formation

* Wind
  * Can deposit 100% more snow than what fell in wind loaded areas

* Rain
  * will weaken the top layer (or lower layers) on day of. After it freezes,
    can create a weak slide surface (or a bed of an avalanche).

* Sun
  * Spring: create a freeze thaw cycle - where ice -> corn -> soup if a warm
    day

* Temperature
  * Rapid warming or cooling can make collapses and compression

* Travel / Metamorphosis
  * More travel affects snow shape - [
  snow flake to grain](captures/snow_grain_formation.png)

* Rounds
  * Found in warmer temperatures
  * If you can make a snowball - you have a round on your hand
  * Create a stronger layer

* Facets
  * Angular, pyramids
  * Do not bond as well - cannot make a snowball
  * _Note_: rounds <-> facets

* Persistent Grains
  * Depth Hoar
  * usually found in shallower snowpack
  * Extended cold or clear weather
  * Create instability in for weeks/months
  * Extended faceted layers - much larger than facets

* Surface Hoar
  * Formed on cold clear nights
  * Ususally with wind
  * Like frost from a cold pint glass
  * Very beautiful
  * Can be a problem later if it gets buried
  * Surface Hoar -> Persistent Grains

## Avalanche Problems

* 9 Types of avalanche problems

* Dry Loose
  * Point release surface snow
  * Carries surface snow
  * Fan Pattern
  * Dangers - can push a skier onto dangerous terrain
  * Can observe steeper slopes with fanning patter / point-release

* Storm Slab
  * New snow avy
  * Snow pack test
  * Hand hardness test
  * Steepness & Convexity
  * The deeper the weak layer the more likely you can create an avy
  * Cohesive snow over a weak layer

* Wind Slap
  * Cohesive layer formed onto a wind-loaded side
  * Look for Recent wind slabs below ridges and cornices
  * New snow can bury these avy
  * This is common in Eastern Sierras
  * _Note_: Can get buried! Hard to spot

* Cornice
  * Accumulation of snow on the leeward side
  * Small to large
  * Can break earlier
  * Check for snow pressure onto cornice
  * Warm temperatures can weaken the cornice
  * Can trigger several avy's below
  * Can be a massive trigger
  * Traveling on ridges can be problematic
  * Can ski on the Elory bowl or mammoth crest can be very problematic

* Wet Loose
  * Description
    * Fan shaped
    * Chunky Debris
  * Signs
    * Observations
    * Rain on snow (dry)
    * pinwheels or roller balls
  * Observations
    * Wet snow from sun/heat
    * Hot temp $>0^C$
    * Can get worse in minutes to hrs
  * Considerations
    * No freeze for nights
  * Rocks can warm up and trigger

* Wet Slab
  * Heavy/wet snow
  * Check for weather patterns - warm weather
  * On the snow - check for wet snow warm snow - soupy type of terrain can be
    dangerous
  * Rain often a culprit

* Persistent Slab
  * Weak bond between layers
  * Can trigger by weight of the rider
  * Often does not trigger by itself
  * Danger can last for weeks or months
  * Check for whumping and shooting cracks
  * Whumping can (initiation) propagate over a very large area
  * Shooting cracks is the propagation - VERY DANGEROUS
  * Do not consider steeper or complex terrain when you observe this

* Deep Persistent Slab
  * More dangerous big brother of the PS
  * Function of a deep persistent layer - can sit for a very long time
  * VERY DIFFICULT to spot
  * Often triggered by a weak spot with a shooting crack
  * Very destructive falls
  * Can loom the whole season

* Glide
  * Full depth crack
  * Take all of the snow off the mountain
  * Can see the cracks from seconds to months after trigger
  * Often occurs by steep or smooth terrain
  * Typically trigger in the same locations - avoid these areas
  * Can propagate into additional avys

## Regions

[regions](captures/snow_regions_us.png)

* Maritime
  * Deep snowpack, warm temps
  * Uniform layers
  * A lot of rounding
  * Avy danger - Quick to rise, quick to fall

* Intermountain Transitional
  * Shallower snowpack  - Moderate to deep laer
  * Cold-Cold temps
  * Surface hoar, facets
  * Powder is really soft due to cold weathers
  * As season progresses - starts to round out
  * faceting -> rounding
  * Avy danger - Quick to rise, slow to fall

* Continental
  * Shallow snowpack - cold temps
  * Variable snow layering
  * Large facet layers, persistent layers are problematic
  * Avy danger - Very slow to fall
  * Late season typically safer\*

## Risk Management

* Terrain Avoidance
  * Ridges, thickly treed areas

* Review ridges and run outs

[Undefined Alpine Anatomy](captures/Alpine_Undefined_Avalanche_Anatomy.png)

* Review terrain in summer
  * Get an idea of what's underneath
  * Boulders are good anchors, talus not so much

* Review vegetation
  * Broken trees
  * Bare sides on uphill side - known as flagging

* Pay attention to aspect (shade vs sun)

* Region - treeline

[Incline Accidents](captures/percents_accidents_incline.png)

* Incline
  * Most dangerous angle is $38^o$
  * $30 - 45^o$ is the "avalanche zone"

[Slope Angle Danger](captures/slope_angle_danger.png)

* Tools
  * Slope angle tools exist online
  * (In)clinometers
  * Compass! - (duh!)
  * Apps

* Terrain
  * >20 - green
  * 20 - blue
  * 30 - steep
  * 35 - double black

[Terrain Trap](captures/terrain_traps.png)

* Terrain Traps
  * Features that increase the consequences of being caught in an avalanche
  * Gullies
  * Roads
  * Valleys
  * Crevasse

* Relentlessly think about the consequences of an avalanche every at all times

## Planning your trip

* Challenges
  * Timing
    * Common timeline
  * Gear
  * Clothing
  * Food
  * External
    * Weather
    * Avy Conditions
    * Conditions
  * Coordination for common goods/equipment
  * Group
    * Level of comfort
    * Level of risk
    * Skill
    * Fitness
    * Dynamics
    * Trust
    * Size - magic number of 3
    * Communications
    * Assessment of expectations - problems that arise

* Human Factors

  * Social Pressure
    * Expert Halo
      * 'everything should be fine' because expert person is here

  * False Confidence
    * over/under confidence

  * Shortcut
    * literal - cold/tired
    * Not bring emergency gear - "it's only a day trip"
    * Back to the Barn - Find yourself in a terrain trap, getting dark, go back
      up and out instead of back down

  * Impaired Objectivity

* Uncertainty
  * Not enough info
  * Ask Questions
  * Kill questions
  * Weather, people, climate, terrain, snowpack add to uncertainty
*
